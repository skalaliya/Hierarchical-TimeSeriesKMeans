# Hierarchical & TimeSeriesKMeans Clustering

This repository contains implementations and applications of two powerful clustering techniques: **Hierarchical Clustering** and **TimeSeriesKMeans Clustering**.

## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to cluster unlabeled data points. It starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster. Then, it repeatedly executes the following two steps: (1) identify the two clusters that are closest together, and (2) merge the two most similar clusters. This iterative process continues until all the clusters are merged together.

## TimeSeriesKMeans Clustering
TimeSeriesKMeans is a variation of KMeans which is adapted for time series data. It aims to partition the time series data into clusters such that time series in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. This algorithm is particularly useful for temporal data analysis and can be used in a wide range of applications including market research, pattern recognition, data mining, and image analysis.
